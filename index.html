    					A little about me.
    				</h2>
    				<div class="half-width">
    				    <p>My journey into web development is somewhat unconventional. I earned BAs in Arabic Studies and Cultural Anthropology, and minored in international development. This led me to project management oriented-work after graduating, with some freelance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA">MENA</a>-related consulting on the side. I’m a lifetime learner who has been interested in technology and computers ever since I was introduced to my family’s first Macintosh desktop in the 90’s, where I’d spent hours coming up with new creations in Kid Pix and playing Prince of Persia.<!--I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. --></p>

    				<div class="half-width">
    				    <p> Later on, during high school and college, I dabbled in coding by creating and maintaining multiple personal blogs on Blogger and WordPress. Fast forward to early 2016 when I began taking beginner’s Python classes with <a href="http://hearmecode.com/">Hear Me Code</a>, which was my formal introdution to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dctech?lang=en">#DCTech</a> community. I adore the structured-creativity that comes along with code, and with my growing web development skill-set, I’m ready to turn web designs into beautiful and pixel-perfect code.<!--That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.--></p>
